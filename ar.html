                    people fire up their Deliverators and start to construct their Burbclaves, the metaverse is being built piece by piece
                    online. As this industry explodes, companies are going to start feeling the pinch as the already scarce UX designers
                    begin to get split between traditional UX and the emerging field of VX, or Virtual Experience.
                    <br><br>Virtual Experience is a practice that spans both virtual reality and augmented reality. VX designers are nearly
                    nonexistent now. With the job not having a great tool to design in, most of the design is done on the fly by virtual app
                    developers and is relatively simplistic.
                    <br><br>But if you’re interested in VR or the metaverse, becoming a VX designer is a strong forward play into
                    futureproofing your job, with bonus effect of making it even more difficult to explain what you do for work to your
                    grandparents and parents.
                    <br><br>So how do you then get started? Here’s a simple roadmap.
                    <br><br>Currently, the best tool you can use for VX design is Adobe XD. Figma doesn’t currently support depth design, so
                    learning how to use Adobe XD if you aren’t already will be a major step in the right direction. If you’re also
                    interested in designing for augmented reality, you can download Adobe Aero, which allows for placing menu items in
                    realspace and practicing creating UI for AR.
                    <br><br>Just like normal UX design, you can begin learning by jumping in and starting to play with the design
                    capabilities of the software, but the best way to learn is intuitively, through experience. In the pursuit of this,
                    you’ll need to purchase a VR headset. Currently, the most cost effective VR headset on the market is the Oculus Quest 2,
                    which you can purchase for about $300 on the oculus website. This headset has seen record sales over Christmas, so it
                    might be hard to get ahold of one, but once you start experiencing VR firsthand, you’ll be able to use your previous
                    experience as a UX designer to see what’s working, what isn’t, and start to establish a mental list of best practices
                    for 3D space.
