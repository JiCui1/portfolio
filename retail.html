                        <h3>Challenge:</h3>
                        <p>Creating an engagine physical interaction that converts into sales</p>

                        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                        <p>To build interactive stations for a retail store:<br>
                            1. A station to promote a single product<br>
                            2. A station to promote seasonal collections<br>
                            3. A touchscreen self-ordering station<br>
                            4. A storefront projection
                        </p>

                        <h3>Why Interactive Stations:</h3>
                        <p>
                            An interactive experience gives a stronger impression than static/passively-consumed experience 
                            especially when the user intializes the interaction.

                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p>Cardiology students often need a 
                                large amount of real case practices to learn to find the most optimal treatment
                                for cardiac disease but the process is often repetitive and mundane which makes it hard to absorb the information
                                and reduces learning efficiency
                            </p>
                            <h3>Potential Solution 1:</h3>
                            <p>A gamified quiz based app that focuses on real case diagonosis question based learning
                                <br><br>
                                Pros: <br>More formal and technical and can be integrated into most medical organizations (higher scalability)<br><br>
                                Cons:<br>Not as engaging as a game
                            </p>

                            <h3>Potential Solution 2:</h3>
                            <p>A full-on mobile game with real case quiz questions as a feature to earn points to be used in the game
                                <br><br>
                                Pros: <br>More interactive and engaging. Potentially better learning outcome for users.<br><br>
                                Cons:<br>Takes the focus away from the knowledge and more towards the game itself
                            </p>

                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>We decided to choose a full-on mobile game as our solution because a game is potentially easier
                                to create internal trigger (from Hooked Model) and a positive reward feedback loop for our user to achieve a better
                                learning outcome
                            </p>

                            <h3>Game Play Design</h3>
                            <p>Since our users can potentially play this game for several months to even years. We have decided
                                the best option is to create an incremental game which requires users to repeat a certain task (answering multiple-choice questions)
                                to earn in-game currency which can be used in making game progress
                            </p>

                            <h3>Game Design Idea</h3>
                            <p>Eventually we came to conclusion that a hospital building game might be the best solution because students can also
                                learn about hospital management in the process and it would allow us to scale the product beyond cardiology as well.

                            <h3>Lo-fi Design of title screen and quiz screen</h3>
                            <p>We put an emphsis on the question and options on the quiz screen and some progress information as 
                                feedback to the user and a timer to create urgency. 3 choices will be given and one is the most optimal choice, 
                                one is an ok choice and the last one is a wrong choice. This design choice came from user interview where
                                the user talked about an important part for diagnosis is to choose the most optimal option from all potential solutions
                            </p>

                            <h3>Hi-fi Design</h3>
                            <p>Overall UI design is to give a techy and minimal feeling to the game itself. A heart beat graph is added to the 
                                quiz screen to simulate the heart condition of the patient. The big crystal heart at the background is used as feedback 
                                system to let users know the result of the choice that they made. Patient condition is highlighted in blue and patient information is shown in a separate box
                                so the doctors would know if this is a returning patient or a new patient.
                            </p>
